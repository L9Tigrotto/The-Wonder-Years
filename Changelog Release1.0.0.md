# The Wonder Years Changelog Version 1.0.0

## üìã General Updates

*List administrative changes, modpack-wide modifications, and other general updates.*

- This is the first release version of the pack. I believe it is stable and reflects how I envisioned the entire modpack, so there are no plans to make breaking changes (changes that would require you to create a new world). If a disruptive change does occur, the major version number will be increased (i.e., from 1.x.x to 2.x.x) and a disclaimer will appear in the changelog.

- Added first iteration of villager trades.

- Added Rainy Swamp Background resourcepack.

- Added Loading Backgrounds resoucepack.

- decreased diamond tier in overwrold loot.
