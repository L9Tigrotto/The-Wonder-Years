## 🎯 What is The Wonder Years?

This is my conception of what vanilla Minecraft should be. Not an overhaul – a refinement.

Every addition feels like it should have been there all along, because I spent a lot of time obsessing over details to make sure nothing breaks the vanilla magic.

## ✨ The Philosophy

You know that deep satisfaction of doing something small, but doing it exceptionally well? That's the core of The Wonder Years.

It's about placing the final block of your little build and knowing that it couldn't be better. It's exploring a structure and finding secrets that feel worth the journey. It's the moment when everything in your world feels perfectly arranged. It's that moment when you step back and realize your world has become uniquely, unmistakably yours. 

Each part of Minecraft is yours to explore with renewed purpose.

## 🌟 Three Ways to Play

Exploration – Overhauled structures, hidden details, and secrets worth finding in every place.

Building – Simple storage solutions, furniture that fits vanilla aesthetics, and tools that work with you, not against you.

Quality of Life – Intuitive inventory management, beautiful animations, connected textures, and countless tiny improvements that save your sanity.

Mix and match however you want. The quest system introduces these three branches at your own pace, or ignore it completely – everything's discoverable through normal play.

## 🎮 Getting Started

Requirements: Minecraft 1.21.1, 4GB+ RAM, curiosity about what Minecraft could be.

Installation: Download from CurseForge, let it handle setup, create a world, play.

First Hour: Everything feels familiar but slightly better. Your inventory sorts itself. The first village you find has personality. Small satisfactions everywhere.

## 💝 A Personal Note

I made this for everyone except those wanting massive technical or magical overhauls. Whether you're new to mods or a veteran seeking vanilla perfection, this accommodates your style without forcing a specific playstyle on you.

Yes, there are over 300 mods. That sounds like chaos, but when each one improves just a tiny, seamless piece of the experience, it adds up to something that feels like Minecraft with its potential finally fulfilled. It's about gentle polish, not radical change.

Thanks for giving it a shot.
